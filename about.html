        <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Anna and Gerry Meatshop is a small, family-owned business that has proudly served the local community for nearly two years. The shop was founded by the passionate husband-and-wife team of Anna and Gerry, who combined their unique strengths to create a warm, reliable, and trustworthy local meat source. Anna, a licensed CDO retailer, brings her business knowledge and customer service skills to the forefront of operations. Gerry, on the other hand, is a seasoned butcher with years of hands-on experience in meat cutting, selection, and handling. Together, they turned their vision into a reality: to provide high-quality, fresh meat to Filipino households.</p>
            <p>More than just a meat shop, Anna and Gerry's store has become a neighborhood staple—a place where customers are greeted like family and where quality always comes first. Thanks to their hard work, dedication, and the unwavering support of their community, Anna and Gerry Meatshop continues to grow. As they look to the future, they remain focused on their mission: to deliver fresh, honest meat with a personal touch, and to be a trusted partner in every Filipino kitchen they serve.</p>
