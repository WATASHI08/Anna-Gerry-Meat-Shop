        <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Anna and Gerry Meatshop is a small, family-owned business that has proudly served the local community for nearly two years. The shop was founded by the passionate husband-and-wife team of Anna and Gerry, who combined their unique strengths to create a warm, reliable, and trustworthy local meat source. Anna, a licensed CDO retailer, brings her business knowledge and customer service skills to the forefront of operations. Gerry, on the other hand, is a seasoned butcher with years of hands-on experience in meat cutting, selection, and handling. Together, they turned their vision into a reality: to provide high-quality, fresh meat to Filipino households.</p>

<p>At the heart of their operations is a shared commitment to cleanliness, freshness, and service. Anna is dedicated to managing the daily workflow, assisting customers with their needs, and ensuring the store is always fully stocked with the freshest CDO products and locally sourced meats. Her approachable and friendly attitude has made her a familiar and trusted face to many loyal customers. Gerry works behind the scenes, applying his skills to prepare clean, precise meat cuts that reflect his years of practice. He emphasizes proper hygiene, storage, and safe handling in every step of the process—values that customers can see and taste in every purchase.</p>

<p>The shop specializes in raw meat products only, with a carefully selected range of pork, beef, chicken, and well-loved marinated favorites like tocino and tapa. These meats are prepared fresh, in-house, and are ideal for home cooks who want to bring delicious meals to their family tables. Unlike commercial outlets, Anna and Gerry Meatshop avoids preservatives and mass production. Instead, they focus on small batches and personal quality control to make sure every cut meets their high standards.</p>

<p>More than just a meat shop, Anna and Gerry's store has become a neighborhood staple—a place where customers are greeted like family and where quality always comes first. Thanks to their hard work, dedication, and the unwavering support of their community, Anna and Gerry Meatshop continues to grow. As they look to the future, they remain focused on their mission: to deliver fresh, honest meat with a personal touch, and to be a trusted partner in every Filipino kitchen they serve.</p>
